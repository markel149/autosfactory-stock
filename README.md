# autosfactory-stock â€” React (Vite) base

Minimal React + Vite scaffold added to the repository.

Quick start (local)

1. Install dependencies:

```zsh
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```zsh
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```zsh
npm run build
```

Notes
- This repo was scaffolded with Vite and React 18. Update versions in `package.json` if your environment requires different Node or package versions.
- If you want, I can open a draft PR with these files and add CI configuration (GitHub Actions) to run lint/tests on push.
